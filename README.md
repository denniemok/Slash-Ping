### Introduction
This is a minimalist plugin with exactly one function: enables the checking of in-game ping with /ping. It's nothing fancy or complicated. It only does the simplest task you ask for, hence the performance and size. <br>

<hr>

### Main Features
- EssentialsX-style default message preset.
- Simple and lightweight; No unnecessary features other than /ping.
- Configure almost everything in config.yml. <br>
Modify ping values with multiplier and offset.
- Exemption to being a ping target is especially useful for admins to go completely invisible from normal players. <br>
Without introducing new exploits to your existing vanish system.
- Bypass exemption is designed for personnel who can see vanished users or have the need to administer at a high level
- Forward compatible to all versions from 1.8 and onwards.<br>
Utilised a reflection approach to retrieve ping values regardless of server versions. <br>
